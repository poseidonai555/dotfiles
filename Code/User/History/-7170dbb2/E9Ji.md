# Structure of the internet

## What is the internet

- A large network of connected computers and devices, it contains intercontinental cables which carry thousands of high volume fiber optic lines

- This cable network is thought of as the backbone of the internet

- Can be thought of as a collection of domain name server routers. 

## What are routing tables

- Routing cables map web addresses to IPs, and tell computers where to go to find websites and resources

- When receiving requests, packets are sent over many routes over the internet, the message can be split into many packets which can take many routes around the internet

## What do routers do?

- They receive packets on a network and forward them to a destination based on an address. 

- Forwards to the next device

- It uses a routing table and algorithm to determine the best route for packet transfer

- This can be hardwired or wireless

## What does a gateway do?

- Can manage packets using many protocols

- Strips all header data from the packet, and adds a new header, in the format needed for the destination network, then sends the updated packet.
