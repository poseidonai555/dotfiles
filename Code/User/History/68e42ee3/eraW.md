# Symmetric & asymmetric encryption

## What is Caesar encryption

- This is when the alphabet is shifted a certain amount of letters forwards for each letter

- The key is the number of letters the alphabet has been shifted by

## What is symmetric encryption

- This is when the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data

## What are the dangers of symmetric encryption

- The message can be cracked if the key is intercepted

- The message can be cracked if the key production process is duplicated

## What is asymmetric encryption?

- Two different keys are used

## What is a key pair

- This is a pair of two keys, one used to encrypt data and the other used to decrypt data

## What is a public key?

- This is a key that is public and does not need to be kept secret

## What is the private key

- This is the key that is never told to anyone, and thus is kept private

- This is often used to decrypt data

## What is a combined encryption key?

- A combination of the senders public key and the recipient's private key

## What are the advantages of asymmetric encryption?

- No one can read the sender's message

- The recipient knows that no one else can read the message as only their private key can decrypt it

- The recipient can be certain that the message is authentic, and hasn't been modified
