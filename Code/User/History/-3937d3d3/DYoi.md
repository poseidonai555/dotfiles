# DHCP

## DHCP Servers

- A device which automatically assigns IP addresses, from a pool of available addresses

- It can assign IP addresses for a computer on a public or private network

- This helps with the shortage of IPv4 addresses

- Active computers request access

- They release the IP addresses back into the pool again

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

- DHCP discovery message is sent, on a reserved IP address

- DHCP server places an offer and lets the device know the available IP address and how long it is prepared to lease it for

- A DHCP request is sent from the device

- DHCP server assigns the device the IP address
