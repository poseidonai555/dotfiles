| Quicker and simpler                        | syntax is simpler, is able to use arrays                                                                                      |
| Compact                                    | End code is much more short, and takes fewer characters than XML                                                              |

## JSON compared to XML

- HTTP request is created and the REST API is called

- The client-side JavaScript passes a HTTP request to the server

- There is a JSON / XML response from the database server

- The browser on the client then interprets this response
