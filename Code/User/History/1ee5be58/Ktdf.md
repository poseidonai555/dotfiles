*PAST*
## Akuma battle

- Battle against fire akuma (Blaze), Marinetteâ€™s parents are burnt along with her bakery.

- Chat Noir snaps her back into battle, as he sees that she is shocked.

- Ladybug becomes determined to defeat the akuma, the akuma seems to be more focused on causing destruction though after seeing the effects its actions are having on the superhero duo.

- Ladybug calls lucky charm and is for once given a straightforward item, a fire extinguisher, she extinguishes the akuma and finds a person in a black suit who used to have been covered by the fire, holding a charred clipboard where the akuma was located. (the akuma is a pyrologist)

## Akuma escape

- Chat Noir has already used cataclysm and now both need to recharge

- Marinette takes the clipboard and detransforms to recharge Tikki with her macaroons, and to wait for Chat Noir to retransform, so he can cataclysm the clipboard.

- While Marinette is detransforming and talking to Tikki, the akuma is commanded to leave the clipboard by Hawkmoth. 

- By the time Marinette transforms back she is unable to find the akuma which has disappeared.

## Conversation with Tikki

- Marinette is much colder and quieter after this moment

- Marinette detransforms, and Tikki comes to the terrible realization of what has happened.

- Tikki warns her that she must change her mind if she wishes to survive, and that many people are going through the same thing as her at the moment, and that she still shoulders the weight of the world.

- Marinette goes to check the remnants of her bakery, and finds it has been scorched to the ground, something changes inside her. 

## Off the grid

- Marinette gets her laptop from the remains of the bakery as Ladybug

- She decides that she needs to go off the grid, so no authorities can put her in foster care or with one of her relatives as she needs to be Ladybug.

- She sends a text to her friends telling them that she needs some time to sort some things out 

- She sends a message to Chat Noir later that she needs at least a month after the akuma incident

- Marinette puts away the vodka and listens

- Tikki tells her that either she messages her friends like she promised a month ago and Chat Noir and meets them, or she will make her give up her miraculous

- Ladybug says that he then doesn't know her

- Chat Noir is shocked, but decides to ask for details when she is not drunk

- He puts in his baton the directions to her house

- He enters the house and takes a look at it, is concerned by the alcohol in it and the lack of anything that isn't for exercise work or sleep (doesn't look like a living environment)

- She detransforms in front of him flops into bed and says thanks, falls asleep pretty much on the spot

- Chat Noir manages to obscure his vision before seeing her detransformed and leaves through the window after sweetly saying goodnight my lady

## Chat Noir

- Chat Noir returns home

- He goes over the event in his head, going over Ladybug's actions

- He tries to make sense of her situation

- He comes up with the idea that she lives alone and that she is not getting on with her relatives, and maybe friends

- He decides to message her bugphone about having another conversation without any alcohol being involved

The next morning

- Marinette wakes up with a huge headache, Tikki once again concerned asks Marinette what happened

- Marinette replied that she can barely remember, that Chat Noir seemed worried about her, and that he took her home

- Internally she realizes that she was in love with him all along and that she had been using Adrien as an excuse to deny her feelings for Chat

- Tikki informs her that Chat left her a message on her bug phone, but that she needs a cookie to transform her again

- Marinette absent-mindedly hands her the cookie and transforms

- After reading the message she replies a lazy "yeah whenever"

## Branching out

- At the end of the day, the superheros meet up at the Eiffel Tower

- She doesn't hear Chat Noir join her on the Tower

- She reacts using her martial art training, and it ends up with Chat Noir strangled against one of the beams of the Eiffel Tower

- Chat Noir sees the pure hatred in her eyes and is scared

- Ladybug apologizes profusely for both her reaction and her behavior the other night

- Chat Noir says something along the lines of, so my Lady what is happening

- Ladybug tries to lie by omission and says that she has just been badly affected by the fact that she couldn't fix the damage from the akuma attack

- Chat Noir realizes she is telling the truth but can tell that it is more than that

- He decides to try a different tactic and ask her what she has been doing for the past month

- She explains that she has been thinking and that if he wants any of her responses to his questions to be accurate, then she will have to change her policy on identities. (She can reveal details about her life, but he can't reveal anything about his, she says it is fair because she has very little to lose, but she assumes Chat Noir does not)

- Chat Noir responds that he is sorry for her and that he does have a lot to lose after consideration of the people who have been affected by the damage from the akuma attack.

- >Ladybug gives details about her situation to Chat (continue this dialogue in the book)

## Decision

- After hearing about Marinette's situation, Chat proposes the idea that Ladybug shares her identity, for the sake of her safety

- Ladybug says alright and detransforms

- Chat Noir is extremely shocked and relieved, he is barely able to hide his emotion at seeing his old classmate again that he and his friends were worried about

- He is slowly processing the fact the two are on in the same and is understanding all the coincidences, such as their synced absences. 

- Marinette sees Chat Noir's reaction and is looks down shyly, and says "not what you expected, huh?"

- Chat Noir comes back to his senses and realizes how his reaction must look and realizes that she thinks that he is reacting this way because of her scruffy attire underneath the suit.

- He makes something up about his reaction having been caused by the fact that they had met under the mask before, and the irony of the fact that Marinette had confessed her love to him, now realizing that it had been a cover-up her identity as she had likely just transform

- Marinette turns scarlet and murmurs "yup"

- Chat Noir thanks her for doing that, the sadness of not being able to tell her that it's him under the mask

- He then remembers the purpose of the arrangement and then asks her for her phone number so that he can call her should he need to. 

## Support

- Chat Noir then realizes that he can offer her support now that he knows her identity (Marinette is wearing sweats to hide her wounds)

- Marinette says that she appreciates it, but reminds him that she is Ladybug and can thus manage herself. 

- Chat then realizes that he shouldn't know as much as he does about her and needs to think about how to bring up her family gently to try and get her to realise that she cannot manage herself.

- He decides to remind her that even superheros need a support network and that he is always there for her.

- She tears up and tries to turn away, Chat gently pulls her face towards him, and says "you can talk to me Ladybug, you can trust me"

- He is so genuine that she just hugs him and cries for a while

- She says that they should go to her house to talk 

- They arrive home, Marinette tells him about what has happened (mention a list of significant details from each chapter, she uses euphemisms and does not tell him about the stabbings and tries to make everything seem optimistic she wants him to stop worrying hence why she came up with idea to tell him everything)

- He mentions the obvious alcohol around the house, and she claims that she only has a drink every once in a while after a long day

- He points out that it's still illegal and that it is poor for her brain development

- He asks about how she is able to live alone

- She explains the fact that she paid some people to be her guardians on paper and that she puts her assets in their names

- Chat Noir realizes that this is the most that he is going to get out of her and decides to stop asking questions

- He wants to know what he can do

- Marinette makes it clear that she has everything under control

- Tikki comes out and asks Marinette to forgive her but that she is doing this for her own good, she then explains to Chat Noir that:
    - everything is not all good
    - she is developing a drinking problem
    - hasn't talked to anyone who is good for her since Chat Noir
    - She hasn't even talked to Tikki
    - She has become very angry and keeps to herself since her parents death

- Chat Noir comes up with the solution of getting Marinette to go back to school

- She insists that she has other responsibilities, protecting the city, drop-shipping, trying to start a business, planning the defeat of Hawkmoth

- Chat Noir comes to the understanding that she is the one keeping the roof over her head, and that she can't just go back to school

- He encourages her to meet up with her friends

- Marinette is unsure about this as she thinks that they will no longer like her after he long absence

- Chat Noir knows that this is completely to the contrary and like him, they just wish they could help her

- He persuades Marinette of this, coming to the realisation that it is not her usual insecurity that is making it so difficult for her to realise this, but the fact that she has lost some of her ability to empathize with people and has become disconnected

- Marinette says that she will contact them at some point when she can find the time, Chat Noir realizes from her tone that he shouldn't push further and that he should drop the subject

## Touched

- Marinette is touched by the genuine care Chat Noir is demonstrating, and realizes that she will likely be seeing him more often (why is she happier about this than she expected?)

- Decides that since he is in her home she should do something for him

- Noticing that it is dinner time she asks him if he wants to stay for dinner

- Chat Noir looks at her like her eyes hold all the stars in the sky, and happily says, if you're sure

- Marinette realizes that Chat Noir doesn't often get to spend time with people either, she wonders why

- She starts to cook Chow Mein for the two of them, her mother's old specialty, she feels a numbed pang within her upon thinking about it and grabs a bottle of vodka off the counter and takes a quick swig of it, Chat Noir notices it, but doesn't say anything

- Chat Noir starts messing around (figure something out he is as curious as a cat)

- Marinette is getting warm cooking over the stove, and so takes her sweatshirt of, used to not having to being alone in her home

- Eventually she announces that dinner is served, Chat Noir, is distracted by delicious smell of the food thinking that it is nothing like what he usually gets at home (high quality bland food, not made with love)
    - Chat Noir is flirtily smirks, and says, "My Lady, you know that the way to a man's heart is his stoma..."
    - He trails off after seeing the uncovered wounds on Marinette's torso (she is wearing a sports bra)

- Marinette slyly responds, what like what you see, not realizing what has come over her

- Chat Noir doesn't respond, she then realizes where he is looking starts racing through her mind for an explanation

- Chat Noir is extremely worried and jumps out of his chair, whilst also asking "what happened?"

- Marinette stupidly mutters nothing under her breath

- Chat Noir asks her if she is safe, and who did this too her, his tone filled with rage

- Marinette finally comes up with the excuse that she accidentally broke the window, and she got it repaired

- Tikki hops off the shelf she was sitting on next to the half empty jar of cookies and scolds Marinette, telling her that she needs to be honest with Chat Noir, because if she doesn't, she won't be able to support herself

- Marinette knows that Tikki is right, this leads her down a thought spiral of how she won't be able to catch Hawkmoth and that he will kill more people

- Chat Noir watches in shock as Marinette crouches crying and starts having a panic attack

## A shoulder to lean on

- Chat Noir tries to grab her arms to comfort her and walk her through a breathing exercise to calm her down, as Tikki instructs him to

- Eventually Marinette comes to her senses and looks at Chat Noir, and remembers the realisation that she came to the night when she got drunk
    - She realizes that Chat Noir likely no longer feels the same and maybe never did, and that he is all she has left, and she can't afford to push him away

- She gives him a hug, and thanks him

- She realizes that Tikki is right, and asks Chat Noir to not make a big deal out of what happened

- Chat Noir, slowly nods, shocked by what has happened, realizing that she is trusting him

- She quietly explains that she was stabbed because she recklessly tried to intervene in a conflict where three armed men where robbing a woman, without her Miraculous

- She tries to casually drop the subject and says "Now food?"

- Chat obliges, but cannot hide the shock, sadness and rage he is feeling (no one hurts his Lady)

- He asks why she didn't tell him or ask for help

- She replies that Tikki is the reason that she is in such good condition

- Tikki replies that if she hadn't healed her that she would have died

- Chat Noir starts crying at this

- Marinette has no idea how to react, so she apologizes

- Chat Noir realizes that it is not safe for her here, and suggests that she should move somewhere else, or stay with them, claiming that what is the use of secret identities if one or both of them are dead

- Marinette replies darkly that she would rather it her than him

- She explains that if she knows her identity, that it can be extorted out of her if she gets akumatised or tortured

- Chat Noir is frustrated, he says that it should be him protecting her

- Marinette says that he should consider it her returning the favor and reminds him how many times she has had to witness his death

- Chat Noir is dumbfounded by her sound logic, but comes up with an idea
    - "If you move in with me, then we will both be able to either destroy or purify an akuma to protect each other before we can get akumatised, and I can eat in my room my father never eats with me anyway, and neither of us will be able to be kidnapped or anything else if Hawkmoth discovers one of our identities"

- Marinette responds "safety in numbers"

- Chat Noir - "You would have my support any time you need it and since we would know each other's identities I could help you reintegrate into your social life"

- Marinette realizing how much she has been missing her friends, school and the sense of normalcy her previous life offered her, she considers taking the lone arm reaching out to her, the lack of legal loopholes she will need to take, no one trying to follow her home, the safety of Chat Noir's arms (she blushes at that)

- She responds that if he can find a way to make things work logistically on her end that she will agree to it 

## Father

- Adrien doesn't care if he has to alter earth's rotation and re-write the stars, he has to convince his father to let Marinette live with him

- He goes home after dinner with Marinette and has a chat with Plagg

- Plagg gives him a pep talk to Adrien and helps give some oversights about how bad of a situation she is in (and points out that if she was hiding the stabbing she could be hiding more for his sake)

- Adrien is now 100% sure he cannot back down and is ready to face his father, who he is worried will not be in agreement with his decision, as he has been keeping to himself much more than usual as of lately.

- The next morning he knocks on his father's door, his father is displeased from the get go that he didn't schedule to see him

- Adrien insists that is an emergency and explains Marinette's situation to the best of his ability (no parents, trying to live on her own by putting her assets under someone else's name, doesn't mention alcohol, mentions that she is in a bad neighborhood and has been in some altercations)

- Gabriel's poker face falls and for a second Adrien sees what he thinks might be sympathy (sympathy is feeling compassion, sorrow, or pity for the hardships that another person encounters. Empathy is putting yourself in the shoes of another) for Marinette, it is really guilt, but he is unaware of this. 

- Adrien watches as his face quickly masks the emotion it displayed previously and becomes cold once more.

- To Adrien's surprise his father says the circumstances merited the unscheduled visit

- The arrangements for Marinette's stay: 
    - Marinette will stay in Adrien's room, he mentions that he is sure the two of them are mature enough to not behave inappropriately
    - Adrien decides that he will sleep on the couch and Marinette will sleep in his bed
    - Marinette will have meals with him and Gabriel when he is available
    - She will return to school as soon as possible and can be tutored if she would like with Adrien to make up for her time away from school
    - This arrangement will be maintained until she has the means to move to a more safe area or decides otherwise

## Full reveal

- The next day after school LB and CN meet for patrol

- Chat Noir tells LB that she will have more than enough living space, won't be bothered often by his father and that he can situate her until she can find a safer place to live

- He tells Ladybug that they will have to share his room but that it is very large and that she will have her own space and that he will sleep on the couch

- Ladybug is shocked by his generosity and first says that she really doesn't want to impose and that it sounds like a large imposition, she says the only way she will agree is if CN at least takes the bed, and she takes the couch.

- CN urges her to agree

- She concedes

- CN asks her when she can do it, she says that she spent the day packing her things, that she only has a few pictures, her laptop and a few clothes

- They both head to her house so CN can help her with her baggage and do the reveal

- They do the baggage first because both of them are filled with nerves

- CN is a little nervous and excited for this, Marinette is not too worried as she thinks it will change nothing, it's not like they know each other under the mask or anything

- They sit down on the couch, and CN tries to warn her beforehand, he says that she actually knows his civilian self

- Marinette is like what seriously, how well do we know each other

- CN enjoying the fun of a guessing game, seeing Marinette happy for once, and a little frustrated is amused. 

- He then realises how different she behaves around his civilian self, and starts getting doubtful

- He then says that before she starts guessing, that she needs to promise this won't change their friendship, and that she acts very different with him when he is a civilian

- Marinette then says if she knows him she doubts that she behaves that differently and then jokes that it's not like he is Adrien Agreste

- CN winces, now seriously doubting himself and this idea, he then says would it be so bad if I was

- Marinette then laughs, and says yes that she would probably not be able to get a coherent sentence out around him

- CN obliviously asks her why

- Marinette then says "well I suppose I can tell you now that identities are out of the way, CN he was your competition, he's the guy I had a crush on"

- CN not used to so much shocking information in so few days, he has his mouth wide open

- Marinette is now blushing at his reaction

- CN slowly starting to process the information and is filled with pure joy, he is now smiling to his ears

- Marinette is confused and says that she thought this is about the last way he would react to such news

- Chat Noir then prompts her saying "well what would cause this sort of reaction, really think, nothing is impossible"

- Marinette then glares at him and states "you killed Adrien"

- He laughs "Try again milady"

- She then suggests, there is no way that this is possible considering all the cat puns, but you ARE Adrien Agreste

- He then smiles, does finger guns at her and says "bingo", he is really proud of himself for this one. 

- She is now baffled, "no way, you, Adrien, your father, wait... YOU'RE NOT KIDDING!"

- He laughs, "Plagg claws in"

- Marinette goes "waaa nononono"

- CN laughs "yours truly milady"

- Marinette "nonoononono don't say that without da mask" 

- Tikki giggles, Plagg shouts for Tikki and zooms off

## Moving in

- Internal monologue about how she is going to deal with moving in with Adrien, and the fact that this along with her drunken love confession is going to go straight to his head

- She then looks him up and down and realises that everything he is wearing is designer

- Marinette "Oh Adrien no, you breally think didn't, God dammit its just CN"

- Adrien is laughing because of how cute Marinette is when she curses

- Marinette "You are wearing designer"

- Adrien "yeah, I'm kind of model" 

- Marinette "you are wearing designer... in the 18th arrondissement"

- Adrien "..."

- Marinette "how are we going to get my stuff to your house"

- Adrien, we can walk it there, we aren't that far"

- Marinette "Are you trying to get us killed"

- Adrien "I'm so confused"

- Marinette "If the people I know around here see you wearing what you are wearing right now, they'll stab first ask for the clothes after"

- Adrien now realises how ignorant he is, and changes into a hoodie and sweatpants that Marinette lends him

- They leave the house with luggage, Marinette mentions that this will take some time to get used to, Adrien accidentally makes eye contact with a gang member

- They get confronted by him and after being asked to run their pockets, Marinette ends up beating the shit out of him, takes his knife, holds him at knife point and says "you see my face, remember it, now you know who not to fuck with"

- Adrien is shocked, they keep walking and Marinette tells him not to make eye contact with anyone again

- They are silent the rest of the way there

- Marinette moves in and sets up some stuff in her room

## First night at Adrien's House

- Have fun with this

## Return to school

- Goes in wanting to stay quiet now thinking that this wasn't a good idea, she gets confronted by Alya for taking what used to be her seat, she sits down and ignores her protests. 

- Explains to her freinds why she had to go off the grid, tries to hide grim details

- Alya is mad, but then sympathises when she understands how if anything about her had gotten leaked she might be in foster care or worse.

- Sports class comes up, she tries to continue wearing her sweats, but is forced to take of her sweatshirt by the teacher, because of danger of heat stroke

- Alya sees the stab wounds

## Confrontation

- They are getting close and falling in love with each other

- Things start to get sweet, and we think that we are going to have their first kiss

- They are asked to go down to dinner, and are interupted

- They have dinner with Gabriel Agreste, he asks if she is well accomodated, ext, and says that he is extremely sorry about what happened to her parents and that she is welcome to stay for as long as she needs

- After the dinner, Marinette comments on how kind his father was, Adrien notes that he is not usually this kind or empathetic and that this sort of behavior is unusual coming from him

- After playing Ultimate Mecha Strike III they go to bed.

- Marinette wakes up in the middle of the night from a nightmare about her parents, she gets up to get some water from the kitchen

- As she is walking down to the kitchen, she hears what sounds like Gabriel Agreste crying, and talking to someone with a high-pitched voice (he mentions that he never wanted to do what he had done to Marinette and who knows how many more people)

- She peers in, to check on if he is okay and out of curiosity and spots Nooroo talking to Gabriel

- Marinette stares at him, his office door wide open, and puts two and two together

- She realises that she needs to keep her identity hidden, and asks Gabriel what she just saw

- She pretends to notice that he is not okay and has been crying, using his guilt to her advantage, she goes up to him, gently places her hands on his forarms and asks him if he is okay

- He claims that he is upset by the loss of his wife, he looks at Marinette crumbling with guilt, barely able to retain his composure

- Marinette swiftly yanks the butterfly miraculous from under his tie and pins him to the wall by his neck

- She says "and what about my parents, and everyone else's loved ones who got burned alive, you just wanted to bring your wife back, but now all you can do is drown in your own self-pity, the only reason I don't kill you right now is because you have a son!"

- She explains how it feels to watch your loved ones burn alive in front of you while being unable to do anything about it, and how everyone else, including her, grieved normally without inflicting harm on everyone else in Paris, she then explained that even though she has the ability to evoque her lucky charm and repair the damages, that he had been putting the weight of the world on two teenagers' shoulders, and that one of them was his own son, she doubts that his wife would have ever wanted that, she then reminds him about the fact that someone else would have to die in place of his wife

- All the while Adrien is woken up by the commotion and comes down, confused, finding Marinette pinning his crying father by the neck, filled with fury

## The Truth

- Marinette, having seen Adrien and heard him gasp unhands his father, and then tell Gabriel that he has the right to know, and that he should hear it from the horses mouth

- Adrien asks what is happening

- Gabriel Agreste is utterly baffled, and has no idea what to say

- Marinette starts by telling him that he could start with the fact that he is a terrorist, or the fact that he made her watch her parents burn alive, either or

- Adrien says "Marinette what are you talking about, Father?"

- Gabriel says "son, I am Hawkmoth, but you must understand, I did this all for you, for us, to bring back your mother, Marinette has made me realise just how selfish and wrong that was, I'm sorry"

- Adrien gets mad at his father and then storms out of the room, claiming that he is calling the police

## Damage control

- Marinette leaves the room scowling at Adrien and grabs Adrien's hand, apologising for losing her temper and dropping such harsh news on him so abruptly

- Adrien is fuming, and so is Plagg and Tikki

- Marinette is strangely calm, she explains to Adrien that before he calls the police or does anything that he needs to take a minute to think, that she has been in several terrible situations before (she doesn't say that its because of his father, but she certainly thinks it)

- She explains that if he calls the police or does anything drastic, that the consequences will stay with him for the rest of his life, that Gabriel knows both of their identities and that he won't be able to keep something like that secret forever. 

- She explains that she has come up with a plan, that she insists that for their own safety, that she uses the miraculous of the Rooster to give one of them the ability to erase specific memories someone has, to erase any memory Gabriel has of their identities. 

- Adrien nods in agreement, teary eyed

- Marinette continues, that his father may have information about his mother and her disapearance as we have no idea what happened to her

- Then Marinette says from there it is up to Adrien how the handle the situation, if they have him arrested as their alter egos, put in some sort of facility, or left alone, she says that she couldn't be the one to take Adrien's father away, and that she knows how it feels to lose someone so important

- Adrien is onboard with the idea, and without meaning too, says that he loves her

- Ladybug says she loves him too and holds him

*Skipped forward in time, miraculous has been used to remove Gabriel's memories of their identities, and Gabriel has been sent to prison as well as Natalie*
## Sacrifice

- Adrien moves into Marinette's place until he is given access to his financial entities

- Tikki and Plagg come up to both of them and suggest a solution, considering the solemn mood of the two teens, who have both lost so much

- They claim that they think it may be possible to restore the permanent damage that was caused by the Butterfly Miraculous and the Peacock Miraculous

- Adrien jumps at this, Marinette however is much more wary, she says that it sounds too good to be true and that life is never that easy

- Tikki explains that she is correct and that it would take a lot of energy out of the person who did it. 

- Adrien wants to do it since he says that it's his mother and that it is his fault for being so oblivious about his own father being Hawkmoth

- Marinette gets seriously annoyed about this, saying that Adrien does not blame her for making the decision to persue the akuma instead of saving her parents, and now he is blaming himself for his father's treatement and neglect of him which was the reason that he never suspected his father being Hawkmoth

- Marinette claims that she should be the one to do it, that she wants to finish this, and she doesn't care what happens to her in the process

- Seeing the look of protest in Adrien's eyes, she doesn't let him get his argument in, before she transforms, grabs the peacock and butterfly miraculous and drops them into her open yoyo to purify them, then shouting miraculous ladybug

## Aftermath

- Immediately after, she falls unconscious and is detranformed, Tikki falls out of her earings completely tired and out of breath

- Adrien is horrified and doesn't know what to do

- Tikki explains that she is still breathing and that she will likely wake up soon, but that they won't know the full effects of what has happened until she does

- After about 10 minutes of Adrien sitting next to her, she starts to spasm and cry out "no, no!"

- Adrien tries to grab her arm and Tikki sparkles on her forhead trying to releave her of whatever is happening to her

- Eventually Marinette's eyes come open, and she is filled with fear, Adrien grabs her hand and tells her that he is here, Marinette calms down

- She remains silent after the incident, she doesn't talk, tears stream down her face

- Adrien asks her what happens

- She simply responds that she doesn't want to talk about it, she does a smile that doesn't meet her eyes and looks away

- Adrien suggests that they should go check if the purification of the two problematic miraculouses has caused any changes

- She asks what he means, and is confused

- He reminds her that they may have undone the damage caused by the two miraculouses

- She then numbly responds oh right, I'll go see if my parents are alright

- Adrien, Plagg and Tikki once again ask her if she is sure that she is okay

- She responds that she will be fine, and reminds Adrien that his mother may be alive

- >Marinette has experienced the deaths of all of those who burned alive and the feeling of entrapment of a magical coma mentally 

## Emilie

- Adrien sneaks into his old home as Chat Noir, which is now a crime scene, and goes down to the basement where he finds his confused mother taking in the garden and her old status chamber

- Adrien is teary eyes and says mother, she doesn't recognise him as he is CN

- He detransforms

- She responds oh Adrien, you have grown up so much, what happened

- Adrien winces at the memories of his father being led into a police van

- He explains that she has been in a coma for a while and that he is not sure what has happened

- She explains that she overused the peacock miraculous which was broken in order to try and have a benevolent impact on society and that she thought her limit was greater than what it was and that she wanted to use all of her energy to try and help others around her, though she didn't want to go beyond her threshhold, as she wanted to be there for Adrien

- Adrien understands, hugs her and explains its good to have her back, and that she is just like Marinette

- Emilie asks who Marinette is, he responds that he thinks she is his girlfreind

## Tom and Sabine

- Marinette walks to her parents house as Tikki is too tired to transform

- She thinks about all the people who burnt alive and how it felt from their perspectives

- She asks Tikki if the people who have potentially been resurected (she is not going in to this with any false hope, she wansts to salvage what is left of herself) will have their memories back
