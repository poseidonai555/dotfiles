# How firewalls work

## What does a firewall do?

- A firewall filters data going both in and out of the network

- A series of rules are set up and if traffic fails the rules, it is blocked

- This prevents unauthorized traffic in and out of the network

## What is stateful packet inspection

- This is a system that scans the contents of each packet is it passes the firewall 

- If any patterns inside the firewall such as those which match the signature of a known virus, they will be rejected

## What is a proxy

- A computer placed between a network and a remote source, all traffic is passed through this computer

- A proxy acts similarly to a firewall and is often configured as a hardware firewall

## What is encryption?

- Makes data unintelligible

- cannot be read if intercepted

- An algorithm and key are used to encrypt data

## What are the two main methods of encryption?

- Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
