# Web CRUD and applications at REST

## Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete

- These are the four fundamental operations for any database or content management system

## Representational State Transfer (REST)

- This enables CRUD to be mapped to SQL functions

- REST API allows JavaScript to talk to a database through HTTP

- The client does not need any knowledge how the database server works

- Client or server can be developed independently

## Table of functions

| CRUD     | HTTP request method | SQL database function |
| Create   | POST                | INSERT                |
| Retrieve | GET                 | SELECT                |
| Update   | PUT                 | UPDATE                |
