Hey, I j wanted some second opinion on a fic I'm making, and I thought you'd be the best person to help me ðŸ˜€. In the fanfic I'm writing, Marinette is unable to cast her cure and has to deal with the consequences of this, some of which are personal. Like at the start of the fic, she has to go into hiding after she loses her parents to the battle, which ofc ik is sad, but I think it adds depth to the canon plot, because there are actual consequences for the battles. How do you think Marinette would recover from this, and how would her outlook on life be effected?
