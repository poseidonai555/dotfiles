Hey, I j wanted some second opinion on a fic I'm making, and I thought you'd be the best person to help me ðŸ˜€. In the fanfic I'm writing, where Marinette is unable to cast her cure and has to deal with the consequences of this, some of which are personal. For example, she ends up having to live on her own because she can't continue being ladybug under a foster family and her parents died in a house fire.

like at the start of the fic, she has to go into hiding after she loses her parents to the battle, which ofc ik is sad, but that adds to the plot and action
