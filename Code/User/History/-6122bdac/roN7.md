# The Internet and how it works

## What are the components of the URL?

- The method (e.g. https)

- The host (e.g. www)

- The website domain name

- The fully qualified domain name (a combination of the domain name and the host)

- The location within the site, the directory of the resource being accessed

- The resource at the end of the location, is the file or resource being accessed

## What are internet registers

- Five global organizations governed by the internet corporation for signed names and numbers 

- These companies hold a database of all the domain names and who they belong to

## How are domain names organized

- They are structured in a hierarchical fashion 
- When this is written out, you work from the bottom up and separate by roots

## What is a domain name system

- An internationally agreed structure which classifies the area an Internet resource resides structured into a hierarchy

## What is an internet protocol address

- A unique address given to a single network device

## How are websites accessed

- URL requested by browser from user 

- Browser extracts the fully qualified domain name and sends it to the DNS server

- The local DNS maps the fully qualified domain name to an IP, and returns it to the browser

- If the DNS doesn't have the mapping in its lookup tables, it passes the requested lookup to a regional DNS 

- If the regional server doesn't have the mapping in its lookup table it is forwarded to the network service providers

- Once the web address is found, it will pass the entry into the look-up tables of the regional server and the local ISP and DNS

- Now that the user has the IP address needed they can access the website on the web server and the files are returned to the browser
