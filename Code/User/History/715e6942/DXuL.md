# Thin client and thick client computing

## What is client thickness?

- Client thickness refers to the amount of processing and storage done in comparison to the server

## Advantages of thick client computing

- This is more robust and reliable, resulting in greater uptime

- This is best when running heavy-duty software

- Does not rely on a constant connection to a central server

## Disadvantages of thick client computing

- Expensive

- Each client needs its own software, more effort needed from the network administration team

- Because of the non-centralised, distrusted nature of this method, there is a greater risk of integrity issues

## Advantages of thin client computing 

- Software updates can be done once, and will be on every client

- Easy to setup, and add new terminals to a network

- More secure as all data is on the server

## Disadvantages of thin client computing

- One fail point, the central server

- Central server must be very powerful and reliable

- Higher demand on bandwidth
