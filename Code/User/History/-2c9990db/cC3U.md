# SSH

## Uses

- Secure remote access to computers and automated processes

- Issuing remote commands

- managing a network away from work / home

- Public key encryption to authenticate user and prevent unauthorized access

## SSH client steps of encryption

1. Client initiates the connection by contacting server

2. Server sends public key to client

3. Server & client agree communication rules & open a secure channel

4. User can now login to the remote server host operating system

## Functions

- SSH client can be used in conjunction with other application level protocols

- Can make a TCP connection on a remote port and send commands to that port using the appropriate protocol

- SSH can be used to tunnel through a firewall on port 22, then requests using other protocols can be sent securely using the encrypted SSH tunnel
