# What is Big Data

## Increasing amount of data

- The amount of data being generated and collected is growing

- 90% of the worlds data has been created in the last 2 years

- It was estimated that in 2020 there would be an excess of 40 zettabytes of data

## What is it

- Extremely large data sets, which can be analysed using computers to reveal patterns, trends and associations, particularly relating to human behaviour and interactions

- The term was invented in the early 2000s

- Data sets have become so large that traditional methods such as querying a relational database via SQL can no longer be used 

## What is data mining

- Trying to discover trends using computation within a large data set

## The problem with big data 

### Volume

- It is too large to fit on a single storage device

### Velocity

- These large data sets must be queried and need to respond in seconds or milliseconds

### Variety

- The data can arrive in many formats, and can be unstructured

- Traditional relational databases cannot be used, they require the data to fit into rows and columns

- Relational databases do not scale well across multiple machines or servers

- Machine learning techniques are needed to analyse big data
