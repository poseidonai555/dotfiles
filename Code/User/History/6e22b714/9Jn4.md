# Representing Big Data

## Fact based modelling

- Data is deconstructed into fundamental units, these are called, these are placed into a master dataset

- Dataset is an ever-growing list of immutable atomic facts

## Principles of fact based modelling

- Raw data is stored as atomic facts

- Facts will often capture a single piece of information

- Facts are eternally true and cannot be changed due to a time stamp

- Each fact is identifiable, so querying can identify duplicates

## Advantages of fact based modelling

- Simplicity, indexing is not needed

- New items are appended to the dataset

- Data is always true

- As facts cannot be modified, errors are easily corrected by referring to earlier good facts

## Using a graph schema

- Can go to the item and follow the edges of the graph to see the linked nodes

- Uses nodes proxies and edges
